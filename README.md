Handle the SOCKS protocol on libevent bufferevents.

I didn't want to write this code twice. Maybe you don't either.
If you are dealing with SOCKS and libevent, feel free to use this library or steal the code ;-)
If you see something that should or could be done better, feel free to complain or open a pull-request.
